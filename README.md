# raspi-setup-scripts

/sh sh versions of install scripts ( simpler )

/py py versions of install swcripts these got overly complicated and I'll probably abandon them

## Installation

```
curl -L  https://github.com/uglygus/raspi-setup-scripts/archive/refs/heads/main.zip --output raspi-setup-scripts.zip

unzip raspi-setup-scripts.zip
cd raspi-setup-scripts
chmod +x *.sh
./setup-samba.sh
./setup-transmission.sh

```

## TODO

- Look into FlexGet
- Start with pre-populated config file. That wil be simplest. Rather than programmatically changing individual parts.
- add a comment to them.

# This config file created by setup-samba.sh on datetime
