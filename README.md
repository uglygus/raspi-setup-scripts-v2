# raspi-setup-scripts

/sh sh versions of install scripts ( simpler )

/py py versions of install swcripts these got overly complicated and I'll probably abandon them

## Installation

```
curl -L https://github.com/uglygus/raspi-setup-scripts-v2/archive/refs/heads/main.zip  --output raspi-setup-scripts.zip

unzip raspi-setup-scripts.zip
cd raspi-setup-scripts-v2-main
sh setup-1-system.sh
sh setup-2-samba.sh
sh setup-3-docker.sh
```

## TODO

- Look into FlexGet
- Start with pre-populated config file. That wil be simplest. Rather than programmatically changing individual parts.
- add a comment to them.

# This config file created by setup-samba.sh on datetime
